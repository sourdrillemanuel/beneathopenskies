When I moved from Denmark to Finland in 2018, I began thinking about bikepacking. Although I had traveled before, I had never done so on a bike. A few months later, I bought a Salsa Mukluk and eventually added a Cinelli Hobootleg Geo to my collection, one of those 29” Drop-Bar Mountain Bikes, along with a packraft to explore the numerous lakes, ponds, and islands of Southern Finland.

After a few overnight trips, I decided to take a train from Helsinki to Kolari, the northernmost train station in Finland, above the Arctic Circle, and cycle towards Kebnekaise, the highest peak in Sweden.

The route was quite monotonous as I mostly followed the main road. In hindsight, there were alternative routes, but I didn't notice them at the time. However, as I approached Vittangi, the landscape opened up, revealing hills and mountains in the distance. Nikkaluokta was breathtaking, especially at this time of year, but the weather was often daunting.

On the way back, I paddled down sections of the Torne River Tornionjoki in Finnish, Torneälven in Swedish, adding another layer of adventure to the trip.
