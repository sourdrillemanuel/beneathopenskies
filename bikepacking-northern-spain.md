must-knows_climate: "Around the Mediterranean basin, summer is usually too hot for cycling. Cycling during autumn in Southern France is nice but beware the orages cévénols, a season of intense thunderstorms in the Cévennes. Corsica is great in autumn: the sea is still warm enough to swim and the highest routes are not yet covered in snow. Sardinia and Sicily, being south of Corsica, have fair weather during fall, especially in Southern Sicily, while the mountainous Northern region might be covered in snow. I found wintertime to be great in Tunisia: in the south, it's between 15°c and 20°c during the day, and around 0°c during the night. The Northern coast might be milder but also wetter and windier. Avoid summer in Tunisia."
must-knows_camping: "I don't know the official rules of each country but wild camping is relatively easy, except in Sicily which has very little preserved nature left. In Tunisia, head for the numerous mountain ranges to camp, away from cultivated lands. Camping in Southern Tunisia is fantastic: open space, no one around and an amazing night sky."
must-knows_nutrition: "Water and food are not a problem in any of the places I have been to. In Tunisia, there are small shops and fast food in every little village and markets in bigger ones. Don't rely on rivers that will be dry in autumn."
