This route is very straightforward, mainly following the main road from Kolari to Vittangi along the Torne River. Unfortunately, the mine in Kaunisvaara results in heavy truck traffic on the main road. However, as you approach Vittangi, the landscape opens up, offering wide vistas and unparalleled serenity.

Last week was pretty hectic between moving into my new flat and preparing for the trip. It took me a whole day to get all the gear on the bike and in the backpack, especially after mistaking washing powder for salt.

I cycled to Kauklahti and took the train to the central station in Helsinki. Once there, I waited for the train while watching the rain pour outside. The train was old school, with a specific compartment for big items. The guy who helped me with the bike offered me a former first-class room with six seats. Way better than my original seat. The ride was long, even though I could lie down and managed to sleep a bit.

I woke up around 6 to enjoy the blue hour and the very moody weather. I admired the beautiful contrast with the orange lights of hamlets and streets scattered among very thick vegetation.

I arrived in Kolari around 9:30. It was cold. After changing my clothes and getting some fresh water, I headed towards Sweden. I rode through very depressing streets with old and abandoned buildings. The sky was overcast, but it wasn't raining yet. The rain started a bit later and followed me for a couple of hours on a dirt track and then on the state road. It was very quiet. The peaceful scenery of rolling hills hidden in low clouds, covered with yellow-leaved birch trees among green pines, was exactly what I came for.

I stopped cycling at 15:30, after 45 kilometers—less than expected because I found a free campsite with a small cabin overlooking the river. I was tired and my butt was painful. I had plenty of time to set up my alarm and rethink my setup to distribute the weight better. The first day of thirty days.

So far, I love the freedom and the simple beauty of the landscape, but I feel like I already miss coziness. Let's see what the next days bring. I am a bit concerned about the weather: it seems to be rainy and cold for the next few days. As I write these words, the sun appeared briefly to cheer me up. I need to toughen up and follow through with my plans.

I woke up a bit before 6 when the sun rose but was too tired to get up, so I slept until 7:30. After packing my gear, eating a quick breakfast, and taking a couple of pictures of the place, I left. The sky was cloudless but the temperature was still low.

Along the road, the contrast between the vegetation, the sky, and the river was stunning. The ride went well. I stopped for a break and took the opportunity of a sunny day to do a quick wash by the river. I stopped for lunch as well, at one of the many stops found between the road and the river. Those little places always have space for a tent and access to the river. Thank you, Sweden, if you are behind those.

After lunch, it really got warm: I didn't need my gloves anymore and took my shirt off for a quick sunbathing session. I kept cycling until Junosuando so that I could get to the supermarket before it closed. In that village, the view of the river was stunning, and one could see some mountains far away in the distance.

I enjoyed my first podcast ever while biking, Philosophize Me. Ibrahim Ferrer kept me company until I stopped for good at 16:00 next to another river, on a small parking lot. It was so warm that I decided to give the packraft a try upstream. It was so hard, but I had fun and realized how easy and fast it is to go downstream. Despite the trucks and cars close to the place, the view was beautiful. The temperature dropped quickly after the sun set, and I quickly went inside the tent. Ready to sleep before 21:00, after a very pleasant day. I hope it goes on.

Right after the sun set, the wind was already gone and humidity appeared. During the night, I woke up and realized that the landscape was covered in a thick fog. The walls of the tent were really wet too. By morning, the fog was gone, but the sky was covered with clouds. It took me two hours to pack all my gear. A really late start.

The ride went well, though I got cold several times. The sky got darker by the hour, and the atmosphere became really depressing. The landscape changed too: wilder, with smaller trees, ponds, marshlands, and hills in the background. I found a beautiful abandoned place for lunch, the kind of place I will remember on the way back if I need shelter. Later, I reached Vittangi, a really cozy town by the river. I bought some food and went to a campsite with grass, a small beach, a nice view, and hot showers. Too good to be true: the owner showed up, and I paid 12€, but the hot shower, electricity, and free toilet paper were a must.

A couple arrived with a campervan: from Switzerland, they were coming back from Tromsø. I wanted to sleep inside the changing room, but it was too dark, so I decided to set up the tent outside instead. I went for a bit of rafting in very shallow waters without removing my shoes, a first and a comfy one. I am concerned with the weather forecast as it will get cold very soon and rainy all week on the other side of the mountains. I'll try to reach the pass before the snow arrives, but I am worried that I will be too late. The future will tell.

I keep thinking of the idea of an electric van that would be extremely minimal (in its interior) with a focus on high-distance efficiency. So far, I find traveling by bike at this time of the year quite hard: I get easily cold, and the weather can be unforgiving. On the bright side: nothing broke, I am physically fine (despite a painful butt), water is abundant, and I pass at least one town every day for food.
