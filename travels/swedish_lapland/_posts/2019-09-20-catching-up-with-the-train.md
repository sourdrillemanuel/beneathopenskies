Having reached the westernmost point of this trip, I began retracing my steps, this time following the river downstream. Each day, the weather grew colder, but the fresh snow on the mountains contrasted beautifully with the yellow-leafed birches, creating a fantastic sight. I camped in the same places as I did on the way forth. By the time I eventually reached Kolari, fall had not progressed as much.

I woke up after 8 this morning, after a good night's sleep. It took me a while to leave my little cabin as I needed to switch to rafting mode. When I eventually managed to get into the raft and leave the shore, the boat arrived, so I had to maneuver to get out of its way. I went down the stream a couple of yards, and when the boat turned its engine, I stayed on the side while it passed over me.

The beginning of the ride was a bit uncomfortable as I couldn't find a good position due to all the gear I had to carry. The scenery was once again breathtaking, and I felt sad leaving these mountains behind me. At some point, I stopped on a small sand island because there were two streams, and I wasn't sure if both would lead to the same lake until I stood up and saw they did. The situation got tricky when I tried to leave the sand island, but every time I got in after pushing the boat a bit further, I got stuck. Eventually, I managed to free myself after getting mud everywhere.

Once I reached the lake, the waves and wind made it trickier, and I wasn't comfortable at first, even less confident to take pictures despite the stunning view. I reached the end of the lake and packed up my gear while discussing with a lovely mother who left Stockholm for Kiruna, seeking to be closer to dramatic nature. She even offered to leave my bike at her place if I wanted to go to Narvik by train.

In the clouds, the Kebnekaise stands at 2,096 metres, making it the highest peak in Sweden.

I reached Nikkaluokta around 13:30, where I paid for the campsite and access to showers and toilets. I met four Czech hikers who had come all the way from Abisko, along the King's Trail. They were as interested in my setup as I was in their route and experiences. I ate two desserts (without a main course) while deciding that I would make my way to Kiruna the next day and Narvik a couple of days after, despite the bad weather forecast.

I set up the tent in the birch forest, took a hot shower, and came back to relax for the first time in seven days. I intend to eat and go to sleep early so that I can leave early in the morning and get to Kiruna before the end of the day. Snow is forecasted for tomorrow morning, so let's see how it plays out.

Today, I left Nikkaluokta way later than I anticipated. The reason was that I met a great guy with whom I spent the morning talking about outdoor activities. Among other things, he is a photographer who earns most of his money photographing people doing outdoor activities, but what he loves above all is landscape photography. He talked about his process, from pitching an empty tent with a light inside to the many conditions needed for great pictures. He spoke about his trips to Alaska and Canada, biking, paddling, hiking, and the dangers that bears represent in some areas. We also talked about people and photographers who inspire us, like Iohan. He offered me some tea, bread, Nutella, and handmade jam from his garden north of Berlin.

I eventually left with the plan to reach my little cabin rather than Kiruna. The weather was daunting, but I made it, brought lots of wet wood inside, and made a nice fire. It's likely better than spending the night in some park in Kiruna. After a week of traveling around, I went through different feelings, not sure if I like what I'm doing or not. The rather cold and wet weather, the roads full of trucks and cars, the lack of gravel roads and single tracks suitable for bikes, and the pain due to the saddle make it hard. On the other side, I got what I wanted, and Nikkaluokta was a gem in terms of contact with people, landscape, and atmosphere. I guess a warmer and sunnier climate, with gravel tracks without traffic, would make it better (Kyrgyzstan, I am looking at you).

Thanks to the fire that warmed up the cabin the day before, it wasn't as cold inside as outside when I woke up. The clear sky was a nice surprise and the fresh snow that came during the night covered the mountains in the background. The sunlight appeared there first, a beautiful sight.

I packed all my gear, fighting with the cold and left. I thought the sun would be welcome but the wind was fierce and freezing. It was a painful and long ride back to Kiruna. I ate a not-so-good falafels and fries at the same place as the one I ate the pizza a couple of days ago. It wasn't good but warm and filling. That is where I decided to shorten my trip and take the road back to Kolari the same day, the reasons being the bad upcoming weather in the area, the cold and all the trucks and cars I would need to deal with to go to Narvik. I'm happy with the decision as it means I'll go home sooner to rest and relax, furnish my flat and enjoy a cosy end of vacation and I will most likely host Nicolas once in Helsinki.

As soon as I left the pizzeria, the rain started and followed me from the grocery store to the small place next to Camp Alta where I pitched the tent when I first came here. I fear the next day as it is supposed to rain continuously the whole day as well. I hope to reach the small cabin I first saw last time I took this road or the campsite in Vittangi tomorrow.

The rain waited for me to pack my gear before showing up and following me all day long. The sky started to clear up when I reached the campsite at Vittangi. A hot shower, a warm meal and a hot tea in a beautiful environment, almost quiet, if it wasn't for a bit a traffic and birds.

Checking the weather in Abisko, I am not looking back at my decision though I still wonder: What now? What do I want to do? Tomorrow should be rainy as well but the next day sounds promising, perfect for bike-rafting.

The car that arrived the night before was still there when I went to the kitchen. I prepared a nice breakfast, with 3 cups of tea. I also called VR to change the date of my ticket train to Friday.

When I came back to the tent, a woman stood by the car. She came here to work for an Australian mining company. Her role was to make an inventory of the species and show the impact the mine would have on the biodiversity. She was really interesting: she spoke French because she lived in Quebec for a while before going back to Sweden, in Stockholm where she left for this new job. She also traveled by bike and shared some of her stories and routes. She left while I was packing my gear and I was so cold that I decided to take a hot shower to warm myself up. It worked, for a while.

I left for the center of Vittangi where I bought some food and then followed the main road for 20 kilometres until a little village where I left the asphalt for a gravel road. Despite the constant rain, it was a beautiful road with various scenery and many reindeer, more than I was able to reckon. I ate peanuts, pesto and cookies for lunch under a tree, while enjoying the silence, but suffering from the cold.

I eventually reached the main road again and camped in the same place I did last time I came here. The rain stopped an hour or so but started again later.

Frozen morning. I was cold, as usual and even slower than the days before. At least, the weather was decent that morning, cold but mostly sunny.

I biked to Junosuando, bought bits of food and reached Lovikka before noon. Switch to bike-rafting mode. It was easy to set up but It took me some time to jump in the boat. I got scared at some point when the wind rose up, throwing me on the side, with sleet, ice and snow at the same time. Also, I almost got stuck in the middle of the river because it got too shallow. The raft touched the ground several times, but not enough to stop it. The rest of the ride went smoothly but slower than expected. I stopped after 15 km, on a small beach. The wind was cold but the view was nice. I packed my gear and ran to the little fishing cabin next to the road I slept in on my way forth. I hesitated to sleep outside but decided to take the risk of staying inside. Thankfully, the weather was nice today.

Looking back at what I have done during the last 13 days, here is what I think: I enjoyed parts of it, during the very first day because it was exciting, the first time I saw some hills and later on mountains, my days in Nikkaluokta. Generally speaking, the roads bored me but the more remote gravel roads were delightful because of the silence and the wildlife.

The cold of the second week made it really painful, especially during the mornings. Autumn was at its top in Nikkaluokta but not advanced enough in Kolari, even when I came back. I am now thinking of going back to Kolari to spend time around Yllas, where there are many bike tracks. It would be a good occasion to go down the Muonio river. I am not looking back to the busy and noisy life of the capital but I look forward to a warm place I can call home.
