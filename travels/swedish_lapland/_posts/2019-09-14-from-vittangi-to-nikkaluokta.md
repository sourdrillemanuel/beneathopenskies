highlights_1_description: "Leaving Kiruna, the route to Nikkaluokta is the true highlight of this trip. At this time of year, the leaves are a vibrant mix of red, orange, and yellow. The road undulates, offering splendid vistas at every turn. Traffic was almost non-existent, making the journey even more enjoyable."

The route from Vittangi to Kiruna is probably the least interesting due to increased traffic near the city. However, the vistas from Kiruna to Nikkaluokta are stunning, featuring yellow-leafed birches, lakes, and bare mountains in the background.

Thankfully, the constant wind prevented humidity from settling on the tent that morning. I packed up my gear and raft (which I had left inflated overnight to dry) in about an hour and a half, which was fine, at least for the beginning. I charged my devices in the warm kitchen (in case I need warmth when I come back, I will have a place to go, if it's still open and warm) and left a bit after the Swiss couple.

The weather was decent (not cold but cloudy). I went back to town to get some food and saw the same old guy, this time sitting in the grocery store, watching people come and go. I packed my newly bought food and left town for the next one. My butt was more painful than ever, but I kept going. It took me quite some time to reach the next town, where I stopped in a small park and cooked in the changing room, watching the light rain fall. It was a good idea. It lifted my spirits. I left the park full and headed towards Kiruna.

The rain didn't come, the sun shone a couple of times, and I had a welcome strong tailwind. The first part was awful: a very tight road with barriers on each side. The second part was stunning: beautiful views, beautiful colors. I kept pushing forward in hope of finding a place to camp and eventually found one next to a campsite at the very end of a large and gorgeous lake.

I wasn't far from Kiruna anymore and studied my options. I would go for Nikkaluokta, perhaps the Kebnekaise station a bit further, and most likely come back, leaving Norway for another time. I think it would make sense to go off-road in the Kiruna region, far from this big noisy road that I have been on for a while now. I met a guy who told me he crossed to Sweden because the weather in Narvik was a nightmare.

Anyway, a good and long day today. Mosquitoes and midges were still present that evening.

I am writing down the memories from today while sitting in a chair in front of the fireplace of a small wooden cabin next to the river, from which one can see what appears to be glaciers.

The day started before 6 when I woke up but decided to go back to sleep until 8. Then, the rain started. I waited until 11 and left anyway. I took the direction of Kiruna, swearing at all the trucks and their deafening noise when they passed me. Ten kilometers later, I reached the outskirts of the city, stopped at a grocery store, and tried my lock for the first time while eating at the pizzeria next to it. The food was mediocre, but it was nice to relax in a warm place, talk to people, and watch others come and go. I ate too much, and it made it very hard to ride afterward.

The rain stopped, and the sun started to clear when I took the direction towards Nikkaluokta. The traffic was more bearable than in the morning, but still, I would have loved some empty and quiet gravel roads. The clouds kept spreading around, leaving bits of blue patches here and there, but the wind got fierce. I stopped at Puoltsa, a small village where I talked to residents. They informed me of a place to camp further down the road and also told me they had never heard of a way to cross the mountains to reach Narvik, and if so, it would require more than a week.

And so, I left this peaceful place and found the little cabin where it says, "for rest only, no overnight allowed." You know the rest. I managed to get a fire going for a couple of hours, which really warmed up the cabin, washed in the river, and cooked a simple meal. The full moon appeared, the sky cleared, and the wind died: signs of a very wet night that I will not spend outside.

Today had the most breathtaking views since I started this trip. I left my beloved little cabin, surrounded by morning fog. I quickly packed all my gear and set my course for Nikkaluokta, around 35 kilometers further. My big toes went numb quite soon, so I had to stop in a different cabin to massage them and bring them back to life. After that, it went smoothly.

The sun showed up, the temperature rose, and I warmed up. The views got more beautiful at every turn. The mountains drew closer and bigger. The ride was tough. I even met the woman from the day before; she stopped by with her car.

It took me around four hours to reach Nikkaluokta, where I arrived hungry and cold. Thankfully, there was a heated kitchen where I cooked and rested while discussing with hikers. I decided to go to the Kebnekaise station, 20 kilometers further.

Eventually, I rode unpaved roads, or rather paths. The ride was unbelievable: a path among a yellowish-leaved birch wood. Truly surreal. After 5 kilometers, where the small boat goes upstream, the path turned into rocks and wasn’t rideable anymore, so I pushed the bike for 7 more kilometers until I reached a little cabin.

I went paddling upstream, and despite the difficulty, it was an amazing experience, especially when a family of reindeer stopped on the shore to look at me and probably decided I wasn’t a threat. So I let the current lead me back to my little cabin. The mountains really are what I love the most; they are so impressive, tall, and attractive. Mountains are the reason I spent 6 days biking on mostly boring roads.

I need to decide what will be the next steps. Do I go back to Kolari earlier than expected and book a new train home? Do I try to reach Narvik via Abisko on the main road? Do I leave the bike somewhere and hike? So far, what concerns me is the pain caused by the saddle, the sore knees, and the upcoming cold weather... A mouse came to visit me in my little cabin.
