Leaving Montpellier behind and heading inland, my journey took me through forested paths and sometimes challenging roads. Yet, the promise of a pristine natural area and the allure of the golden hour kept me going. As I settled for the day under pine trees, the excitement for the final leg of my adventure loomed.

After a great time in Lattes and Montpellier, I left after lunch, a bit sad but happy to know that I'll be with my parents the next day at that time.

The ride through the forest park of La Guardiole was fine, apart from the dangerous stretch between Vic and Cournonterral. The view up there was indeed nice. The road became nicer and quieter the further inland I got.

Palavas is a seaside resort, south of Montpellier. It lies between the Étang de l'Arnel, the Étang du Méjean, and the sea.

Eventually, I reached the natural area I wanted to see, and the golden hour made it look really nice. Some of the single tracks were challenging, but the last part was spent on dirt tracks and small roads. I found a spot below pines right next to a small paved road, between vineyards. It's hot today. Forty kilometers to go tomorrow. Excited!
