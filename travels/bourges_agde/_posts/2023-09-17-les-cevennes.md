It is a part of The Causses and the Cévennes, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. An enjoyable mountain bike track encircles the entire plateau, offering occasional views of the deep gorge below. The eastern part presents a different landscape from its western counterpart, with a greater prevalence of forests. As you approach the Perjuret pass, you can catch a glimpse of Mont Aigoual."

These two days, I ventured through lush valleys, unique limestone plateaus, and picturesque villages with distinct rock-topped roofs. The rugged Causse Méjean plateau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, unfolded breathtaking vistas, creating an otherworldly atmosphere heightened by dramatic storm clouds and occasional patches of blue sky. My journey led me along dirt tracks and single trails along the edge of the incredible Gorges du Tarn, where these remote landscapes not only offered solitude but also introduced me to a fellow traveler with a unique story.

The ascent from Bagnols-les-Bains to Mont Lozère was quite steep, requiring me to push the bike most of the way. The first section in the valley was stunning with lush vegetation, a high canopy, and high humidity. Once out of the valley, the tracks became less steep and much more flowing.

There was a lot of wind up there, and I felt cold for the first time on the trip. The colors were stunning between the brownish look of the fauna, the dark clouds, and occasional patches of blue sky. The descent to Saint-Jean-de-Mondvert was fantastic.

Saint-Jean-de-Mondvert, a lovely village situated between the Mont-Lozère and the river Tarn.

The weather forecast predicted a significant amount of rain further south for the next day, so I made the decision to change my route and head west toward the Gorges du Tarn. Once at the bottom of the valley along the River Tarn, I rode towards Florac. The road gradually descended, with each turn revealing the impressive cliffs of the gorges. I stopped at Florac for groceries.

The lovely and lively center of Florac Trois Rivères, in Lozère.

The climb to the Causse Méjean was tough but absolutely worth it. At the top, the light and scenery were amazing. After a delightful mix of roads, dirt paths, and single tracks, I found a remote and cozy spot in an open pasture surrounded by the forest. Sheltered from the strong winds in the forecast, I fell asleep peacefully in complete silence.

It's already 21:45 when I settle down on the mattress and start writing down my thoughts. During the night, it rained a lot. So much that I had to put my rain jacket on top of my sleeping bag because of a leaking roof. I woke up late, to a covered sky but the same beautiful spot. It took me a long time to pack, and I left at 9:45.

From time to time, I could spot a drop in the landscape, allowing me to see far below into the Gorges du Tarn. The further west I went, the better the weather. The sun accompanied me all afternoon while a gigantic dark mass of clouds and rain hovered over the Cévennes. Everywhere I looked, there were spots to camp, often in pine forests or tiny meadows.

I met a bike traveler. He had just reached the plateau after a climb from the gorge. He was 65 years old and had a unique style of baroudeur. We talked a lot while my sleeping gear dried.

La Malène is a small village located at the heart of the Tarn river Canyon. Encased between the Causse de Sauveterre and the Causse Méjean plateaus.

The west ride was fun. Half small road, half dirt track. There were hikers. I stopped at the abandoned hamlet with its fantastic via over the gorge, to charge my phone with the sun. The scenery changed suddenly in the evening when I reached a pass leading to the southern causse. No more cozy forests. Only steppes, fields, and small patches of pines. The clouds got closer or I got closer. The sun was already set when I arrived at the spot, in a not so nice pine forest. What a fantastic day. What a place.
