intro: "As I ascended to higher altitudes, the mornings grew colder. Each day presented challenging climbs and the occasional encounter with fellow bikepackers. The Cézallier region stood out as the true highlight of this route. At the summit of the pass, the vista of the Sancy Massif and Monts du Cantal was truly breathtaking. The dirt tracks and small paved roads descending from Cezallier were mesmerizing. The final campsite, overlooking the Gorges de la Truyère, was undoubtedly one of the best of the entire journey."
