It is one of the five natural regions that make up the Regional Natural Park of the Volcanoes of Auvergne. The average elevation of the massif ranges from 1,200 to 1,500 meters. The highest point in the massif is the Signal du Luguet at 1,547 meters. Up there, the view is incredible."

As I ascended to higher altitudes, the mornings grew colder. Each day presented challenging climbs and the occasional encounter with fellow bikepackers. The Cézallier region stood out as the true highlight of this route. At the summit of the pass, the vista of the Sancy Massif and Monts du Cantal was truly breathtaking. The dirt tracks and small paved roads descending from Cezallier were mesmerizing. The final campsite, overlooking the Gorges de la Truyère, was undoubtedly one of the best of the entire journey.

It was much colder this morning. Being at the bottom of the valley, the air was cold and damp. Everything was wet. My hands ached; it might have been close to 10°C. I really needed the rest so I rose up at 7:30 and left an hour later. The morning route was very nice. I stopped a long time in a little village before resuming my climb towards La Chaine des Puys. It was a tough day, and I didn't expect it to be so hard.

The iconic Puy de Dôme is a lava dome and one of the youngest volcanoes in the Chaîne des Puys region of Massif Central in central France. Its elevation is 1,465 m.

On the GTMC, I met two weekend bikepackers and was amazed at how lightly they packed. I always thought I was among the lightest travelers but I was wrong. The open roads were so beautiful. The view of the Sancy was majestic. I damaged my derailleur with a branch, so I had to tweak it for a while before it worked again. This afternoon was hard with lots of climbs. I chose a different route than the GTMC, and the results were mixed. The last climbs were hard, and not finding any spots was frustrating. Eventually, I found one in an abandoned and overgrown field. Close to this spot, cars come and go. A caravan is there as well. However, I am completely hidden but still have a fantastic view of the south.

I will indulge in a long sleep tomorrow as the route will be harder than today. I'm a bit worried about the idea of climbing the Plomb du Cantal: it looks so tough and uninteresting (climbing a ski resort). Also, thunderstorms are planned for Tuesday, and I don't want to be up there when it hits.

Many cars came and went late into the night and early in the morning, but my camp was so well hidden that I wasn't worried. I slept well and woke up at dawn. The descent to Murol was great, and once there, I realized I had parked in that same street during New Year's Eve with Yohan, Mathilde, and Enzo, a few years ago.

There were motorbikes everywhere, and I understood why a few kilometers further: there was a special event. Thankfully, there were none on tracks and trails. The ride between Murol and Besse was difficult. I didn't expect Besse to be so pretty. From there, the scenery was stunning all afternoon and reached its climax in the Cézallier. There were many hikers between each lake. I met one with whom I talked about. He once was homeless for 4 years.

The Lac de Montcineyre is a lake near Compains. It stands at 1182 m above sea level.

For the first time of the trip, I stopped at 18:00, at the top of a pass, at 1440 m. From up there, I could the Massif du Sancy and the Monts du Cantal. The view was stunning. I called Grandma, Mom and Dad, before cooking and eating while looking at the landscape. Only then did I install the tent.

The Mounts of Cantal are the remnants of the largest stratovolcano of Europe, which last erupted approximately 2 million years ago. The Puy Mary (1,787 m), and Plomb du Cantal (1,855 m, 6,086 ft) are its highest summits.

This morning, the ride down to Murat was mind-blowing: the first dirt track down the Cezallier was mesmerizing, the following paved roads were very different but so enjoyable. Murat was a beautiful town. There, a restaurant refused to fill my bottles because I didn't buy anything. Classic! I had lunch on a bench next to the supermarket where camping cars kept coming and complaining because the shop was closed during lunch. A running gag. The climb up the pass wasn't too hard, but the descent was fantastic: the last little road next to the river was so picturesque.

In this region, everything seems more burned and dry, making me feel much closer to the Mediterranean basin. The last kilometers were spent on small and picturesque paved roads, with beautiful pines scattered here and there between pastures.

Tonight, I found a fantastic spot facing southeast, towards the Aubrac plateau. Unfortunately, a deep valley separates us, which means a lot of descending and ascending tomorrow morning. I'm glad I kept going because I had found two other spots earlier, but I wasn't convinced. Hopefully, there won't be any wind or rain because I am completely exposed on two sides.

I quite like this kind of camping spot where I'm quite remote, but I overlook the lights from nearby hamlets. Thinking about it, I like spots that are a bit more protected from the unpredictability of the weather, but that usually comes without a view.

The numbers say I have reached the middle of my trip. Six more days to go then. Let's say seven, because I think the Cévennes will be tough.
