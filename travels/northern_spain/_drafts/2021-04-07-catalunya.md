From sneakily crossing borders to navigating tricky roads, I've soaked in the beauty of diverse landscapes. The route took me through charming villages, many challenging ascents and stunning landscapes. Each day unfolded like a unique adventure, from bustling beachside tracks to silent medieval towns and hidden gems.

Today marked one of my best riding experiences since I set out. The scenery was consistently breathtaking, starting with a challenging descent from the border. The thrill of entering a new country, coupled with encounters in a different language, had me excited beyond measure. Navigating a perilous road, I reached a vast supermarket, where it turned out surprisingly challenging to find prepared food.

Massif du Canigou

Riding along a picturesque small road to the next village, the landscape shifted significantly, featuring fig trees and majestic views. The day unfolded between charming paved and dirt roads, creating an exhilarating journey.

As the day drew to a close, I approached the last pass before the city and discovered the sea closer than anticipated. The town, perched on mountains cascading into the water, reminded me of Positano. A visit to the port, relaxation on the beach, and observing people amid a new lockdown in France added unique layers to the day. Encountering a fellow Kona enthusiast, I regret not engaging in more conversation.

The evening climb in Cap de Creus led me to a discreet spot away from the main path, hoping to evade any issues. Tomorrow, an early start is planned for the next chapter of this thrilling adventure.

Much like the previous day, today's ride was a rollercoaster of awesome moments. Starting early from my illegal yet stunning spot, I captured a few shots, took a quick shower, and had breakfast, still struggling to comprehend the beauty around me.

The descent to the plains was a blast, although I had to dodge quite a bit of traffic, both cars and pedal-powered folks. A visit to the first supermarket I encountered filled my supplies for the day. Negotiating through traffic and mundane landscapes, the ride became less exciting until the unexpected sight of a small Venice caught my attention.

Completed in 1975, Ampuriabrava is the largest residential marina in Europe, with some 24 km of navigable waterways.

After lunch, returning to the coastline felt like stepping into a less polished country, complete with litter, abandoned buildings, and unattractive beaches. However, a charming medieval town emerged, bustling with tourists and offering a beautiful contrast. Riding through a vast pine forest between two towns, I treated myself to an ice cream, charged my phone, and zipped through a fun dirt track.

Subsequent dirt tracks were incredibly smooth along the Rio Ter, accompanied by a tailwind and a picturesque sunset, creating a blissful ride. As night approached, I struggled to find a suitable camping spot until a dense forest with towering pines welcomed me. Opting not to use the rain cover, I settled into a lovely spot amidst the tall trees.

Fun fact: Earlier that day, I spotted fields of grass being grown and cut like carpets, adding a quirky touch to an already unique day.

It's barely 9 pm, and I'm already feeling the day's ride in my bones. I left a bit later than usual, banking on the remoteness of my camping spot to allow for a more leisurely morning.

The stretch to Girona turned out to be surprisingly interesting, thanks to the hilly terrain sculpted by the Rio del Ter. Arriving in town, I checked my Warmshowers messages and got a hit. A member couldn't host me but offered a camping spot. Opting for exploration over rest, we decided to meet for lunch instead.

While the bustling streets deterred me from a full city visit, the snippets I caught were stunning. Lunch with my newfound friend was a blast—enthusiastic and full of laughter. He guided me to the supermarket, where I stocked up on two days' worth of food and got a glimpse of the start of the green way. Excited to head towards the mountains, my friend suggested a different route, but after weighing my options, I stuck to my original plan—following the river.

The climb to the massive dam wasn't as tough as I'd imagined, and the cliffs around the lake were truly impressive. Transitioning from a paved road to a barely drivable dirt path, I found a cosy camping spot under small trees and decided to call it a night.

Some mountain bikers appeared before I had time to pack all my gear. I crossed paths with many while continuing on my route. It was quite cold. Parts of the trail were smooth while others were a bit more technical. Overall, it was really fun, and the views were even more impressive than the day before. Once I reached the next dam, it became more accessible, and there were already tourists. The route was somewhat illogically designed, with constant ups and downs at impossible angles. I almost hit a car when a bump surprised me. It kept climbing for a while until I reached the pass.

I ate next to a restaurant, expressing frustration at Warmshowers members who only offer a tent in the garden. From there, I went down to the river once again and followed it through lovely single tracks. I believe the little peaks here and there were ancient volcanoes. The scenery was fine without being mind-blowing.

I climbed further, leaving the valley behind me, took a shower next to a stream, and found a spot in a very dry field, overlooking part of the lovely valley. Clouds were coming in my direction but, as of this writing, not a single drop has fallen.

The tent was damp in the morning, but from where I stood, I could see the valley below covered in a thick blanket of fog, the same valley where I had considered staying the night.

Once I departed from the paved roads, the route became notably challenging: a mix of steep and narrow single-tracks, and double-tracks that weren't. It proved to be the toughest part of the trip.

Well past noon, I reached the summit, had a bit of food but saved some for the evening. The descent towards Berga was exhilarating: long dirt roads following the river. From a distance, I spotted the Serra de Cadi and patches of snow here and there.

Upon reaching Berga, I felt relieved that Gemma could host me. I went to her spacious house in the hills, cleaned the bike, washed the clothes, and took a shower. We discussed the mountain bike route in the Pyrenees that I had first noticed on OpenStreetMap without knowing what it entailed. Looking at her map, I realized I would be leaving the mountain areas for smaller ranges in the days to come. It would probably be the last time I'd see snow.

We cooked and enjoyed crèpes together, and I returned to the tent for a well-deserved internet session. This half-day rest was very welcome, as I needed to get fresh clothes and charge electronics before continuing.

Days are stretching, and with each passing day, I find myself extending my rides a bit further. Today marks the beginning of the fourth week, and it rained only once during my journey so far, a gentle drizzle during the first morning.

Today, I departed from Gemma's place around 11, shortly after her boyfriend's arrival. We exchanged brief words, and I headed to the supermarket, setting my course for Solsona along a quaint mountain road.

The initial climb through the commercial area was brutal, too steep for a fully loaded ride. It took a while to conquer, but once on the road, the terrain eased, revealing delightful scenery. After a satisfying meal on the other side of the pass, the afternoon was a thrilling descent, occasionally interrupted by sections of a rough yet beautiful dirt path. The end of the long weekend might explain the solitude on the route, a welcome serenity as I navigated through soft, green hills.

Approaching Solsona, the last stretch was a bit challenging but remarkably tranquil. A pause at a church treated me an amazing encounter with a Spanish tourer, eight years into his travels. His heavily laden bike bore witness to the miles. I bought provisions in the city as fatigue set in during the afternoon.

As evening descended, I left the urban bustle, camping under the pines near the citadel's parking. Dark clouds loomed over Berga, hinting at possible rain. Surprised by the late hour of reaching the city, I look forward to covering more ground in the days ahead.

Today brought the chilliest temperatures since the beginning of my journey. The morning greeted me with a brisk wind and overcast skies. I clung to my gloves until noon and kept my insulated layer on for most of the day. Eventually, the clouds dissipated, the sun warmed the landscape, and the wind softened.

Despite a moderate morning ascent, the day unfolded mostly downhill. The remote morning dirt roads led me through solitude, encountering no one for several hours. The scenery was breathtaking, with stunning views.

Before lunch, a descent brought me to lower altitudes, revealing expansive fields. Following Emma's recommendation, I adjusted my route but overlooked the midday "siesta," forcing a wait of an hour and a half for shop openings. After restocking for the next day, I continued riding until late, struggling to find a suitable campsite.

Finally, at the valley's bottom, a thrilling descent along an empty gravel road among olive trees unveiled a captivating scene: the sunset reflected on a lake, bordered by trees and imposing rocky cliffs. I settled near an abandoned house, surrounded by cliffs, relishing the simple joy of maintaining a steady pace for a while.
