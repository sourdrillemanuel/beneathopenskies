intro: "The route took me through the beautiful Gorges de la Truyere and onto the striking Aubrac plateau. This plateau featured a rugged, yellowish-burned landscape. The ride to Saint-Chély d’Apcher was fantastic, including some lovely forested sections and perfect dirt paths. As I approached the Mont Lozère, a couple warned me about wolves, but I remained undeterred."

highlights_1_description: "From Saint-Urcize to Malbouzon, the scenery feels otherworldly, characterized by a lack of flora, the predominance of rocks and grass, and a yellowish, burned appearance. A mix of the official hiking trail and alternative small paved roads adds an element of enjoyment to the journey."
highlights_2_title: "The fast-flowing tracks around Charpal lake"
highlights_2_description: "From Sainte-Eulalie to the Charpal lake, the trails are fast-flowing, often winding through coniferous forests. The lake itself offers a pleasant setting, creating a sense of seclusion despite its actual accessibility."
