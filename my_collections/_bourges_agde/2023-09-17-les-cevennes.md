intro: "These two days, I ventured through lush valleys, unique limestone plateaus, and picturesque villages with distinct rock-topped roofs. The rugged Causse Méjean plateau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, unfolded breathtaking vistas, creating an otherworldly atmosphere heightened by dramatic storm clouds and occasional patches of blue sky. My journey led me along dirt tracks and single trails along the edge of the incredible Gorges du Tarn, where these remote landscapes not only offered solitude but also introduced me to a fellow traveler with a unique story."

highlights_2_title: "Causse Méjean"
highlights_2_description: "Causse Méjean is a limestone plateau located in the Lozère department of southern France. It is a part of The Causses and the Cévennes, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. An enjoyable mountain bike track encircles the entire plateau, offering occasional views of the deep gorge below. The eastern part presents a different landscape from its western counterpart, with a greater prevalence of forests. As you approach the Perjuret pass, you can catch a glimpse of Mont Aigoual."
