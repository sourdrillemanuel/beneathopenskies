            <p class="text-md gray-72">After a great evening with amazing friends, the next day was spent mapping the route, preparing the bike, and playing Risk. I left at 5 pm for my first kilometers of the trip and arrived at my aunt's house an hour and a half later.</p>
            <p class="s-mt-16 m-mt-24 l-mt-32 text-md gray-72">Leaving the city wasn't pleasant because of the traffic but the last few kilometers were quite nice: The view of the Acheneau River was very picturesque and the last unpaved stretch was a blast. It was a nice surprise to see my cousin as well. I had a very nice evening there: We ate delicious goat-honey croque-monsieur and watched family pictures before eventually going to bed.</p>

My aunt and I ate breakfast while my cousin was already hard at work. I prepared my things under a blue sky, wondering if I should bike in shorts. I chose not to and it was a good decision: the wind turned out to be cold. Still, It was great weather to bike.</p>

I wasn't expecting to enjoy that area but I actually did: the tracks were varied, the traffic absent and the scenery peaceful. I spotted many different birds nearby a stunning manor and its beautiful garden.</p>

I liked the farms and little ports as well. It felt alive with sea-related activity and the lack of visitors made it like it was all for me to enjoy.</p>

Back on the mainland, I disliked the various touristy towns but the paths were excellent and the forest sections stunning. I was still biking when the curfew hit but I found a great spot soon after, next to the sea and under a pine. It was an easy day with various sceneries, a perfect tailwind, and mostly good weather. It isn't hard to enjoy a trip in these conditions.</p>

I eventually got up at 8 am. There were light showers and the sky looked very dramatic. I packed all the gear and left. I stopped at a supermarket in the morning where I bought food. There, I met a tourer: the poor kind. He had awful gear (including a trailer for kids fully packed with heavy stuff) but already traveled more than two thousand kilometers in France. He seemed to really enjoy it. We parted ways.</p>

The path alternated from coastline to swamps. The wind was fierce but the weather kept getting better. I switched from the greenway to the hiking trails here and there for added pleasure. I found an amazing spot under the pines, next to the sea just like yesterday. The sunset over the sea was breathtaking. Surfers were still having fun way past the curfew. As was I.</p>

My hands were painful while packing up the gear but the clear sky and rising sun made up for it. I left without eating breakfast because it was too cold. Once I left the coastal forest, the scenery became boring. Swamps and fields replaced pines. However, I met two really interesting tourers on the way to La Rochelle. We parted ways for lunch. I reached the Pertuis Breton and had fun riding it, thanks to a strong tailwind. I was very nostalgic when I reached the city, having studied there for a year. There were lots of people everywhere and as I was excited to meet Nicolas, I rode like a madman to his place. It was so great to see him and we had a lot of fun that evening. I discovered Rocket League.</p>

I would have loved to stay a bit longer. The morning was cold but the temperature quickly rose. The sky was entirely blue. It was probably the least interesting day of the trip: the scenery was boring apart from the coastline path at the beginning and the very end of the day along the canal and in the little villages. I met my first ascents of the trip. I arrived at Laurent's place before the curfew. Isabelle had just arrived. I quickly charge my electronics, washed my clothes, and showered. I was stunned by how stressed they are and the little amount of time they have for themselves. We didn't spend much time together as they were busy but I was glad to be there as I had not seen them in years. I cooked for myself because they were having moussaka. I could write for hours on the subject but I couldn't help but feel sorry for the stress they put on their kids and themselves. How long can they go on like that?</p>
