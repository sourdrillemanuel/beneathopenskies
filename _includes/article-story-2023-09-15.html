It felt so good to wear clean clothes after a good shower. I was indeed covered with dust. Unlike last night where I was anxious about thunderstorms, I welcomed them once in the house, and watched in awe as the sky tore itself apart and rain fell down violently all evening.</p>

The plateau is crossed by the route to Santiago de Compostela, so there were a lot of hikers, but no cyclists.</p>

It feels rough and hostile, with yellowish-burned colors and dark rocks. The dirt tracks were nice all along, especially the last fast-rolling stretch to Saint-Ch√©ly, which isn't a beautiful town.</p>

The ride was mostly on great unpaved tracks with some single tracks. The views from up there were great even though I wasn't sure of the mountains I spotted in the background. The only landmarks I could see were the Gorges du Tarn and the Mont Lozere. Actually, I can see the Gorges from where I set up camp tonight: an open patch of grass, next to a track facing west and the sunset.</p>

But having no idea of its precise location, I decided to stay here. As for the wolves, I don't care. Perhaps I should.</p>
