    <p class="s-col-span-6 m-col-span-12 l-col-3-11 s-mt-16 content-w justify-self-center text-lg gray-12">It was much colder this morning. Being at the bottom of the valley, the air was cold and damp. Everything was wet. My hands ached; it might have been close to 10°C. I really needed the rest so I rose up at 7:30 and left an hour later. The morning route was very nice. I stopped a long time in a little village before resuming my climb towards La Chaine des Puys. It was a tough day, and I didn't expect it to be so hard.</p>

I always thought I was among the lightest travelers but I was wrong. The open roads were so beautiful. The view of the Sancy was majestic. I damaged my derailleur with a branch, so I had to tweak it for a while before it worked again. This afternoon was hard with lots of climbs. I chose a different route than the GTMC, and the results were mixed. The last climbs were hard, and not finding any spots was frustrating. Eventually, I found one in an abandoned and overgrown field. Close to this spot, cars come and go. A caravan is there as well. However, I am completely hidden but still have a fantastic view of the south.</p>

I'm a bit worried about the idea of climbing the Plomb du Cantal: it looks so tough and uninteresting (climbing a ski resort). Also, thunderstorms are planned for Tuesday, and I don't want to be up there when it hits.</p>

I slept well and woke up at dawn. The descent to Murol was great, and once there, I realized I had parked in that same street during New Year's Eve with Yohan, Mathilde, and Enzo, a few years ago.</p>

Thankfully, there were none on tracks and trails. The ride between Murol and Besse was difficult. I didn't expect Besse to be so pretty. From there, the scenery was stunning all afternoon and reached its climax in the Cézallier. There were many hikers between each lake. I met one with whom I talked about. He once was homeless for 4 years.</p>

Murat was a beautiful town. There, a restaurant refused to fill my bottles because I didn't buy anything. Classic! I had lunch on a bench next to the supermarket where camping cars kept coming and complaining because the shop was closed during lunch. A running gag. The climb up the pass wasn't too hard, but the descent was fantastic: the last little road next to the river was so picturesque.</p>

Unfortunately, a deep valley separates us, which means a lot of descending and ascending tomorrow morning. I'm glad I kept going because I had found two other spots earlier, but I wasn't convinced. Hopefully, there won't be any wind or rain because I am completely exposed on two sides.</p>
