intro: "In 2020, I had done several short bikepacking trips. But in March 2021, I left home with a longer bikepacking trip in mind. And so, during 3 months, I explored Northern Spain, from it easternmost to its westernmost point. I discovered an outstanding variety of landscapes. It was always mountainous, often tough, but never boring."
