intro: "The journey kicks off in Nantes and heads towards the charming Bay of Bourgneuf. Nowadays, the area is all about oyster and salt farming, giving the scenery a unique touch. Once you move past the bay and cruise from La-Barre-de-Monts to La-Faute-sur-Mer, you'll notice the coastline is mostly urbanized, though its inhabitants remain sparse during the winter months. Scattered along the shoreline are pockets of dunes and pine forests, standing guard over the wetlands nestled farther inland. Moving on from La Faute-sur-Mer, you'll discover the Baie de l'Aiguillon, where the river La Sèvre Nortaise joins the Atlantic Ocean – a bustling hub for bird migrations. Following a pause in La Rochelle, I decided to switch from the EV1 to the V92, also known as La Flow Vélo, which led me towards Saintes. As I made my way to Saintes, a subtle transformation began to unfold, altering the landscape, vegetation, and architectural character that surrounded me."

I arrived at Mathilda's empty but unlocked flat right before the thunderstorms. It felt so good to wear clean clothes after a good shower. I was indeed covered with dust. Unlike last night where I was anxious about thunderstorms, I welcomed them once in the house, and watched in awe as the sky tore itself apart and rain fell down violently all evening.

After a great time in Lattes and Montpellier, I left after lunch, a bit sad but happy to know that I'll be with my parents the next day at that time.

The ride through the forest park of La Guardiole was fine, apart from the dangerous stretch between Vic and Cournonterral. The view up there was indeed nice. The road became nicer and quieter the further inland I got.

Palavas is a seaside resort, south of Montpellier. It lies between the Étang de l'Arnel, the Étang du Méjean, and the sea.

Eventually, I reached the natural area I wanted to see, and the golden hour made it look really nice. Some of the single tracks were challenging, but the last part was spent on dirt tracks and small roads. I found a spot below pines right next to a small paved road, between vineyards. It's hot today. Forty kilometers to go tomorrow. Excited!
