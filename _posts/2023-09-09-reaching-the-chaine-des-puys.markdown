intro: "This bikepacking adventure began in the sweltering heat of Bourges. Initially, I followed the hiking trail GR 654, then continued along the Canal du Berry before eventually ascending to the Chaîne des Puys, where the temperature was more bearable. The journey provided opportunities to witness architectural beauty and breathtaking landscapes, with nights spent along riversides or in peaceful pine forests."

highlights_1_description: "Between Saint-Florent-sur-Cher and Saint-Amand-Montron, I followed the GR 654. Although primarily a hiking route, it mostly consists of small roads and dirt paths that are easily rideable on a gravel bike. The route frequently switches sides along the river Cher, providing beautiful tracks and scenery"
