intro: "Before reaching Toulouse, a significant portion of the route remained rather uneventful and less captivating: After departing from the Flow Vélo near Cognac and making my way towards Barbézieux, I continued my journey along the EV3 until I reached the Canal de la Garonne. It wasn't until Toulouse and the Canal du Midi that I noticed a shift in the scenery: The flora started undergoing a transformation, the Pyrenees loomed in the distance, and the paved paths transitioned into dirt trails. The final hundred kilometers or so within the Parc naturel régional Corbières-Fenouillèdes marked a striking change – they were considerably more engaging."

highlights_1_description: "Originally named the Canal Royal en Languedoc, this canal is often regarded as one of the most remarkable construction works of the 17th century. Technically, its beginning aligns with the endpoint of the Canal de la Garonne. Stretching all the way from Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea, the landscape's flora undergoes a transformation as one heads eastward, with the Pyrenees forming a captivating backdrop."
highlights_2_title: "Parc naturel régional Corbières-Fenouillèdes"
highlights_2_description: "Stretching between the l’Orbieu and La Têt rivers, you'll find 75 km of dirt paths and charming country roads that treat you to some stunning views. Head North, and you've got the Montagne Noire, showing off its highest peak – the Pic de Nore. Look to the South, and you'll catch sight of the Canigou, standing tall at 2,784 m. The flora here showcases Mediterranean characteristics – think garrigue, pine forests, and evergreen oaks."
