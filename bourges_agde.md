must-knows_climate: "Around the Mediterranean basin, summer is generally too hot for cycling. Cycling during autumn in Southern France is pleasant, but be cautious of the orages cévénols, a period of intense thunderstorms in the Cévennes. Corsica is a fantastic destination in the autumn: the sea remains comfortably warm for swimming, and the highest routes are not yet blanketed in snow. Moving south from Corsica, both Sardinia and Sicily offer favorable weather during the fall season. Southern Sicily, in particular, enjoys pleasant conditions, while the mountainous regions in the north could experience snowfall. During wintertime, I discovered Tunisia to be an ideal destination. In the southern part, daytime temperatures hover between 15°C and 20°C, dropping to around 0°C at night. The northern coast experiences milder temperatures but is also prone to higher levels of precipitation and wind. It's advisable to steer clear of Tunisia during the summer months."
must-knows_camping: "I'm not familiar with the specific regulations in each country, but generally, wild camping is quite feasible, except in Sicily where preserved natural areas are scarce, and cultivated lands numerous. In Tunisia, you can explore the various mountain ranges for camping, steering clear of cultivated lands. Camping in Southern Tunisia is particularly enchanting, offering expansive open spaces, solitude, and a captivating night sky."
must-knows_nutrition: "Access to water and food hasn't posed an issue in any of the locations I've visited. In Tunisia, you'll find grocery stores and fast-food options in even the smallest villages, along with bustling markets with fruits and vegetables in larger ones. However, it's important to note that relying on rivers may not be viable during autumn, as they tend to run dry."

In September 2023, I embarked on a journey towards the Mediterranean Sea, spanning across the Massif Central, a region containing a large concentration of around 450 extinct volcanoes. I witnessed the changing landscapes, from lush valleys to arid plateaus, and eventually the unfamiliar scenery of Southern France. Along the way, I reflected on the joys of bikepacking and wild camping, all while inching closer to my destination and a heart-warming reunion with loved ones.
